Tyra Biosciences, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company, focuses on developing next-generation precision medicines for fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) biology. The company offers SNÃ…P, an in-house precision medicine platform which precise drug design through iterative molecular snapshots to predict genetic alterations for developing oncology and genetically defined condition therapies. Its lead product candidate is TYRA-300, a selective inhibitor of FGFR3 which is in Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with mUC and other solid tumors. The company is also developing TYRA-300 for long-term complications associated with skeletal conditions including achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and other FGFR3-driven genetic syndromes. Its product pipeline also includes TYRA-200, an FGFR1/2/3 inhibitor with potency FGFR2 fusions and molecular brake mutations for bile duct and solid tumors; FGF19+/FGFR4, a FGFR4-specific inhibitor that is active in the presence of the V550 gatekeeper and the C552 Cys mutations for liver and solid tumors; and RET, a specific inhibitor that is active in the presence of the V804 gatekeeper and the G810 solvent front mutations for the treatment of lung and thyroid cancer. The company was incorporated in 2018 and is headquartered in Carlsbad, California.
